#### Feature extraction
Developed functions that need for read wave file, compute FFT and extract
 features from them.
 <br/>
 Developed features:
 ```
Mean frequency (in kHz)
Standard deviation of frequency
Median frequency (in kHz)
First quantile (in kHz)
Third quantile (in kHz)
Inter-quantile range (in kHz)
Skewness
Kurtosis
Peak frequency
```
